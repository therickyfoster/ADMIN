💬 Live Chat Prompt Kit

These are automated or streamer-triggered chat prompts that encourage viewers to co-create solutions and audit governance ideas live:

Phase 1 — Kickoff

"Type !trust to share one thing you need from government to feel heard."

"If you could change one local policy today, what would it be? Type !policy"

Phase 2 — Deep Dive

"Vote on our current topic: Type !yes or !no to support this initiative."

"Type !audit to request a transparency check on a public promise."

Phase 3 — Action Commitments

"We’re designing solutions live. Type !idea to submit your improvement suggestion."

"Want to hold leadership accountable? Type !pledge to join the verification list."

🛠 Interactive Widget Ideas

Real-Time Promise Tracker — syncs with a shared Google Sheet or GitHub Issue list so progress bars update live.

Civic Poll Pop-Ups — small polls that appear on stream with chat-driven voting.

Viewer Badge System — awards “Transparency Advocate,” “Civic Auditor,” or “Policy Crafter” roles based on participation.

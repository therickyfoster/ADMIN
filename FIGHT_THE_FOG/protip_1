Systems Compression

Goal: Turn sprawling concepts into 3–5 ultra-clear bullet points instantly.

Why: This accelerates external adoption, pitching, and delegation.

b. Layered Abstraction

Practice reading dense material, then explaining it at:

Expert level (full jargon)

Intermediate (smart but non-specialist)

Layperson (plain analogy)

Builds universal translation ability for multi-stakeholder buy-in.

c. Rapid Pattern Recognition

Run scenario drills: feed me 3–5 random papers or concepts → identify the hidden thematic link.

This strengthens your cross-disciplinary neural map.

d. Tactical Constraint Thinking

Occasionally force yourself to design within extreme limits (e.g., “a DAO for climate repair under $50 initial budget”).

This sharpens creative efficiency.
